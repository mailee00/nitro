	<h1>Our Era Defines Us</h1>
	<h2>The Three Keys</h2>
	<p>The past, the present, and the future. <strong>These three keys make up the concept of time.</strong> Perhaps you've found yourself wishing you could manipulate the flow of time or experience life in a different era. Maybe you're not "built" for modern life. You long to bang sticks together in a cave, during a time when life was <em>simple.</em> You long to live vicariously through the eyes of a virtual avatar in the Metaverse, as the high-tech, dystopian society around you collapses.</p>
	<p>Whatever your secret desires are, you can't say that you haven't daydreamed about living in a different era <em>at least</em> once.</p>

	<h2 style="color:#FF0000">The Past</h2>

	<h3><i>What would your life be like if you were born long ago?</i></h3>
	<p>Were you actually born in the wrong generation? Do you <em>really</em> want to live in the Middle Ages, battling leprosy and the bubonic plague? Or fighting for your life in a gladiatorial ring? I mean, it's your choice, I guess. If you insist that life was better centuries ago, be careful which time period you pick.</p>
	<p>(Just remember that toilet paper wasn't invented until 1857.)</p>

	<h2 style="color:#00FF00">The Present</h2>
	<img src="images/present.jpg" alt="A modern-day man in green with a symbol denoting the present.">
	<h3><i>What is your life like today?</i></h3>
	<p>Okay, so maybe you aren't a fearsome shogun, a noble's court jester, or a member of an up-and-coming barbershop quartet in the 20th century. Did they have Playstations and PCs? No. Toilet paper? Depends. But the point is, I'm sure you've got some sort of modern convenience you wouldn't trade for a life in the past, right?</p>
	<p>Wait-- what do you mean "no?"</p>
	<p>Ohhh, you'd rather entertain the idea of a futuristic society. Listen, I know you think having an android house servant is cool, but what's going to stop them from gaining sentience, draining your bank account, and fleeing to Europe? I heard the A.I. Rights laws in Europe often rule in favor of androids seeking asylum. What if your android turns against you? Lies in front of a court? Slanders your name and <b>SENDS YOU TO PRISON?!</b></p>
	<p>Sorry, I mean... we're only hypothesizing, right? That could never happen.</p>
	<p>As long as you stay safe in the warm embrace of the modern era, that is.</p>
	<hr>
	
	<h2 style="color:#0000FF">The Future</h2>
	<img src="images/future.jpg" alt="A cyborg man in blue with a symbol denoting the future.">
	<h3><i>What would your life be like if you were born far into the future?</i></h3>
	<p>By now you're thinking, "Hey, this all seems a little biased against the past and future." And to that I say, "Incorrect." I just want you to be safe, to think about your actions, to not make any choices you'll regret. It's not always rainbows and butterflies on the other side of the timeline, you know.</p>
	<p>Let me put it to you this way. Do you <em>really</em> want your life dictated by mega-corporations? I think that sounds pretty horrible. And say you get that cybernetic eye you've been coveting from the shady, black market tech dealer around the corner. Who are you going to call when it shorts out? Not the tech dealer. He's already fled to Europe with the android that betrayed you.</p>
	<p>Sometimes you have to ask yourself the difficult questions. I'm just looking out for you.</p>
	<p>What did you say? "Why am I taking your fantasies so seriously?" Uh... No reason. I thought we were just talking.</p>

	<h2>To be Linear, or Nonlinear, That is the Question</h2>
	<h3><i>I don't care what the scientists say, time travel is 100% impossible. Don't even think about it. It's all fake.</i></h3>
	<p>The <abbr title="The International Society for the Study of Time">ISST</abbr> think they're <em>soooo</em> smart with their little academic journals and international conferences. They don't know the half of it.</p>
	<p>Wait, you're still here? Oh. Well, thanks for reading. I hope this little chat has helped you reconsider some of those fleeting desires. No reason to idly waste time on things that will never happen. Thinking about jumping timelines is just plain silly. Remember: The era you were born in is the one you belong in. Run along, now. Back to your Playstations and PCs.</p>
